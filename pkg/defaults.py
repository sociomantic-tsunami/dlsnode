The dls node is a server which handles requests from the dls client defined in
swarm (swarm.dht.DlsClient). One or more nodes make up a complete dls, though
only the client has this knowledge -- individual nodes know nothing of each
others' existence.

Data in the dls node is stored in file system, under the data directory, with
a separate subdirectory per data channel.'''
